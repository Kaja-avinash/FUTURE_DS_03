# 🚧 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Task 3 – Accident Data Analysis for Safety Improvements

This Power BI dashboard project analyzes road accident data to identify high-risk areas, trends, and root causes, aiding in the development of effective safety measures and data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🔍 Objective

Analyze road accident datasets to:
- Identify **accident hotspots** using geographic mapping.
- Examine **trends in accident severity** over time.
- Discover the **main causes** contributing to accidents.
- Suggest insights for improving road safety.
